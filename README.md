A SCP: Secret Laboratory LabApi plugin that shows when the next respawn wave will happen.

# Features

- Fully customizable timer that may show additional info, like round time, server TPS, amount of spectators, enabled
  generators etc.
- Different timer interface depending on a player group name.
- Option for adding multiple custom texts (hints) to the interface, where you can put advertisements and/or gameplay
  hints for players.
- Option for hiding the timer interface (Server-Specific Setting)
- Compatible with [HintServiceMeow-LabApi](https://github.com/MeowServer/HintServiceMeow/releases/latest).

# Configuration

When you first install the plugin, the `DefaultTimer` folder will be automatically downloaded. You are free to edit the
config files inside this directory as you see fit. You can change how the timer looks like, hints etc. Removing
`DefaultTimer` folder will redownload it once again after server restart.
